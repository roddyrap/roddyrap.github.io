Hi! My name is Roddy Rappaport.  
<br/>
I am a high-school computer science graduate, but I learned most of the things showcased on this website by myself. Programming has been a hobby of mine for years at this point and is something I greatly enjoy.  
<br/>
Whether it’s completing an assignment for school, making something for a friend, or sitting late at night trying to figure out what went wrong, making things has always been a pleasure.  
<br/>
I made this website to put in it my most presentable projects. I hope that some people will find the projects handy. Or at least fun to look or laugh at.  
<br/>
Enjoy!
